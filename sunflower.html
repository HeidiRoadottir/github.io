      The sunflower lanyard is meant to discreetly signal that the wearer has an invisible
      disability and may need extra understanding. This project investigates how the lanyard
      is actually interpreted in public space – and how it can both support and stigmatise
      the people who wear it.

          <h2>Context & problem framing</h2>
          <p>
            The sunflower lanyard has spread widely as a symbol for hidden disabilities.
            Many wearers and relatives describe it as helpful – but it also comes with
            ambiguous reactions: curious stares, misunderstandings, or feelings of not
            wanting to “out” oneself in public.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our group has personal connections to the lanyard, which informed the project’s
            motivation: to explore how it is read by others, and how it shapes the
            embodied experience of being visible as “different”.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>My role</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Co-developed the problem framing around visibility, stigma and control.</li>
            <li>Contributed to the design and execution of critical design experiments.</li>
            <li>Participated in analysis of responses and experiential reflections.</li>
            <li>Helped connect theory (e.g. Goffman, Garland-Thomson) to design outcomes.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Design experiments</h2>
          <h3>Exploratory experiments</h3>
          <p>
            Early experiments explored how people perceive images of sunflower lanyard
            wearers, what assumptions they make, and how the lanyard functions as a
            social symbol. Surveys and visual materials were used to surface stereotypes.
          </p>

          <h3>“Boxed stigma” & public interventions</h3>
          <p>
            Later prototypes functioned as “social mirrors”: critical artefacts and
            setups that intentionally made staring, judgement and discomfort more visible.
            These were tested in semi-public contexts to observe reactions and facilitate
            discussion about who has the power to look and to label.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Outcome & contribution</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of proposing a “better lanyard”, the project uses design to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Expose the ambivalence of visibility for people with hidden disabilities.</li>
            <li>Show how the sunflower symbol can both protect and mark out the wearer.</li>
            <li>Invite reflection on who is allowed to stare, interpret and define others.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The work positions critical design as a way of negotiating social norms
            rather than solving them, contributing to discussions on inclusive design
            and disability representation.

          <h2>Reflections & learnings</h2>
          <p>
            This project deepened my understanding of how design can be used as a
            research method in sensitive topics. It also sharpened my awareness of the
            ethics involved when working with symbols tied to vulnerability and identity.
